# Crowdfunding_Prediction
Predictive analysis on crowdfunding success result using machine learning techniques 

## 1/Business Understanding 

Kickstarter, is one of the biggest crowdfunding platforms where businesses and individuals could make an open call for funding in exchange of non-beneficial return. 

Given the ‘ all or nothing’ principle on Kickstarter, the project initiator could only get funded once their fund goal is reached within a limited period. Therefore, not all projects will successfully raise funds. In 2022, the success rate on Kickstarter is approx 30%. 


Thus, the idea of this study is to examine 1. whether social media promotion could impact the outcome of a crowdfunding campaign and 2. predict the campaign using twitter data and kickstarter data. 

## 2/Data: 
Monthly scrape of the Kickstarter website ( March - December 2020-2021)  but since June 2021, scraped files seem to be smaller

Tweets obtained using the Twitter API (from 01/03/2020 to 13/10/2021)
